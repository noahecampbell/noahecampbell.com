          <h3>Germany</h3>
          <p>I am currently in LA right now, so there is nothing to know except that later on in the summer, I will go to Germany and will
          have updates for you. So don't worry!</p>
          <p>Saturday, June 28 11:23, Sorry if you are waiting for the next update for this and it hasn't come. I will have that update in
          22 days, thank you for your patience! I landed in Germany, but I will not go into detail. I won't because I have a website that
          does, it will be public in about 9 weeks, if not less. I'll have updates for you later!</p>
          <p>July 20, 12:13AM, I am in Germany now, and on my other website, which I am having problems with, has all the updates about the trip.
            It will be fixed soon, and when it is, I will tell you guys, the URL is,</p>
            <a href=http://whatthecode.com>whatthecode.com</a>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>These will be my favorite hobbies. Once again, I recomend all of them to you.</p>
          <h3>Pixelmon</h3>
          <p>Pixelmon is something called a mod for minecraft. Or you can just download Technic Launcher and them download the modpack
            for pixelmon. I would search for pixelspark. There will be a link below for Technic Launcher.</p>

          <a href="http://technicpack.net">technicpack.net</a>

          <h3>Doctor Who</h3>
          <p>Doctor Who is a popular show from 1965. Amazing right? Knew it! So, it has aliens, such as daleks, cyberman, prisoner
            zero, and others.so it is the best! Also, it is about an alien that looks like a human, but is called a time lord.
            There are many enemies of them because they are one of the most powerful species ever! There main enemy is a species
            called the daleks, they are the scariest and merciless of them all! There was a time war, which was time lords vs. the daleks.
            The Doctor, that is his name for the show, almost wiped out both species, but some of the daleks survived, by using the
            most powerful bomb. So now he travels in his TARDIS with companions that always end up either dieing, or just stops traveling
            with him. By the way, if you want to watch it, you can on netflix, or BBC.</p>

          <h3>Minecraft</h3>
          <p>Most of you know and play minecraft, so you know all about it. For those of you who don't know what minecraft is, or
            just don't know what to do on it, it is a video game for Ipods, Ipads, Iphones, computers, and for xbox! You can have servers,
            which is a world where a bunch of other people can play on and team up with other players, or just do PvP. I will have some servers
            down below. There is something called mods where you can add more things to minecraft, to know more you can watch a video on
            how to install mods, or you can ask a friend. There is a link below for minecaft.</p>

          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>Coding is a big part of the world! Making websites require coding, even this one! Though this kind of coding is really easy
            to learn and use. So I would recommend one of the more challenging ones, like on octopress. If you don't know what
            octopress is, it gelps you make a REAL website. You need all kinds of coding laungauge. Like HTML, CSS, sometimes JAVASCRIPT,
            and sometimes even RUBY, there is anotherone that is really hard to learn that I am trying to learn called PYTHON.
            So there will be a link below for octpress if you are interested. If you would like to know how to code, just go to codecademy.com
            There will also be a link below for codecademy. I hope you like coding! Oh, if you are wondering why the two websites are next each
            other, I don't know why, it is a bug, so I will have it fixed soon. :-)</p>

             <h3>Whatthecode.com</h3>
             <p>About whatthecode, I have lost the URL for the website, and not only can I not make it public, but I cannot see my changes, or
                see it in general. I am so sorry. I will tell you when I have it and when it is available to the world.</p>

          <h3>Before middle school and how I feel about it</h3>
          <p>I am going into 6th grade, and I am excited, after all, all my friends and I are going to the same middle school, Paul Revere!
            I just can't wait until it starts!</p>

            <h3>During middle school</h3>
            <p>Middle school is awesome! I kept moving from one class tp another, like charter professient, the charter honors, then the best,
              magnet homors! It is so cool with different teachers and different people in each class so you can make friends with them!!</p>

          <h3>Freinds</h3>
          <p>Friends can be found in many places, in the world, your house, and your heart. People can have many freinds, like me. My
            #1 friend is Hayden! He helps me with anything on a computer when I need help when my dad isn't around. There is also Andrew,
            Lukas, Brendon, Nickolas, Dimitri, and many more as well! Friends can help you accompilsh anything, not literally, by helping you when
            you need it, and cheering you on. So if you are shy, don't worry! Nobody is out to get you, nobody hates you.</p>

            <h3>Hunger Games</h3>
            <p>The Hunger Games is an incredible book and movie series! There are 3 books. The first is called "The Hunger Games", the second is
              "Catching Fire", and the third is "Mockingjay". The first and second movie have come out already. So has mockingjay, but as part 1,
              it came out on Friday. I'm going to see it on Sunday.</p>
