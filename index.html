         If you don't, remember, it is my first time doing this.This webpage will include some of my favorite hobbies, and I would
         recomend all of them to you. By the way, I am making a new website! It is private right now, but it will show up eventually.
         I will have a link for it when it's public, which is going to be soon. I may stop having updates so, thank you!</h2>

          <h3>Germany</h3>
          <p>I am currently in LA right now, so there is nothing to know except that later on in the summer, I will go to Germany and will
          have updates for you. So don't worry!</p>
          <p>Saturday, June 28 11:23, Sorry if you are waiting for the next update for this and it hasn't come. I will have that update in
          22 days, thank you for your patience! I landed in Germany, but I will not go into detail. I won't because I have a website that
          does, it will be public in about 9 weeks, if not less. I'll have updates for you later!</p>
          <p>July 20, 12:13AM, I am in Germany now, and on my other website, which I am having problems with, has all the updates about the trip.
            It will be fixed soon, and when it is, I will tell you guys, the URL is,</p>
            <a href=http://whatthecode.com>whatthecode.com</a>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>These will be my favorite hobbies. Once again, I recomend all of them to you. If you want me to include YOUR hobbies, tell me
          which ones to add, and I will add them!</p>
          <h3>Pixelmon</h3>
          <p>Pixelmon is something called a mod for minecraft. Or you can just download Technic Launcher and them download the modpack
            for pixelmon. I would search for pixelspark. There will be a link below for Technic Launcher.</p>

          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>Coding is a big part of the world! Making websites require coding, even this one! Though this kind of coding is really easy
            to learn and use. So I would recommend one of the more challenging ones, like on octopress. If you don't know what
            octopress is, it gelps you make a REAL website. You need all kinds of coding laungauge. Like HTML, CSS, sometimes JAVASCRIPT,
            and sometimes even RUBY, there is anotherone that is really hard to learn that I am trying to learn called PYTHON.
            So there will be a link below for octpress if you are interested. If you would like to know how to code, just go to codecademy.com
            (which will be right on top of the comment box). There will also be a link below for codecademy.</p>

          <h3>Before middle school and how I feel about it</h3>
          <p>I am going into 6th grade, and I am excited, after all, all my friends and I are going to the same middle school, Paul Revere!
            I just can't wait until it starts!</p>

            <h3>During middle school</h3>
            <p>Middle school is awesome! I kept moving from one class tp another, like charter professient, the charter honors, then the best,
              magnet homors! It is so cool with different teachers and different people in each class so you can make friends with them!!</p>

          <h3>Friends</h3>
          <p>Friends can be found in many places, in the world, your house, and your heart. People can have many freinds, like me. My
            #1 friend is Hayden! He helps me with anything on a computer when I need help when my dad isn't around. There is also Andrew,
            Lukas, Brendon, Nickolas, Dimitri, and many more as well! Friends can help you accompilsh anything, not literally, by helping you when
            you need it, and cheering you on. So if you are shy, don't worry! Nobody is out to get you, nobody hates you.</p>

            <h3>Hunger Games</h3>
            <p>The Hunger Games is an incredible book and movie series! There are 3 books. The first is called "The Hunger Games", the second is
              "Catching Fire", and the third is "Mockingjay". The first and second movie have come out already. So has mockingjay, but as part 1,
              it came out on November 21, 2014.</p>

              <h3>Multiple webpages!</h3>
              <p>I have another webpage! The link to it will be after this section. This will have all the crafting recipes. I will keep
                making more webpages until one of the three following things happen, 1:I don't want any more webpages, 2:All of the subjects here
                are fine, or 3:The computer won't let me make anymore. I think the latter will never happen(latter means later one). Also, the newest
                one, the one nearest to the bottom, has a lot of bugs in it, when I say bugs, I mean stuff like glitches and things like that.
                I now have a third one! Everytime I get a new one, I won't always shout it out, in fact, this is the last time I am shouting this
                out, from here on out, I will only put down the link to the new webpage. This is now a website.</p>
