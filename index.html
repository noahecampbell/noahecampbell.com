          <h5>Pixelmon</h5>
          <p>Pixelmon is something called a mod for minecraft. There will be a link to download Pixelmon below.

          <h5>Coding</h5>
          <p>Coding is a big part of the world! Making websites require coding, even this one! Though this kind of coding is really easy
            to learn and use. So I would recommend one of the more challenging ones, like on octopress. If you don't know what
            octopress is, it helps you make a REAL website. You need all kinds of coding laungauge. Like HTML, CSS, sometimes JAVASCRIPT,
            and sometimes even RUBY, there is another one that is really hard to learn that I am trying to learn called PYTHON.
            So there will be a link below for octpress if you are interested. If you would like to know how to code, just go to codecademy.com
            (which will be right on top of the Multiple webpages! section). There will also be a link below for codecademy.</p>

            <h5>Hunger Games</h5>
            <p>The Hunger Games is an incredible book and movie series! There are 3 books. The first is called "The Hunger Games", the second is
              "Catching Fire", and the third is "Mockingjay". The first and second movie have come out already. So has mockingjay, but as part 1,
              it came out on November 21, 2014.</p>

              <h3>Multiple webpages!</h3>
              <p>I have another webpage! The link to it will be after this section. This will have all the crafting recipes. I will keep
                making more webpages until one of the three following things happen, 1:I don't want any more webpages, 2:All of the subjects here
                are fine, or 3:The computer won't let me make anymore. I think the latter will never happen(latter means later one). Also, the newest
                one, the one nearest to the bottom, has a lot of bugs in it, when I say bugs, I mean stuff like glitches</p>

                  <h4>Question 1:</h4>

                <h5>Daftpunkonsole</h5>
                <p>Some of you might know something called Daft Punk. There is a website called daftpunkonsole.com. It allows you to play one of
                  their songs. I will not spoil it and tell you which one. The link to it will be down below. The DaftPunkonsole webiste is now
                  disabled. I am creating something similar to it, I will use similar code, and create it again, only now with the Doctor Who
                  theme.</p>
