          <h3>Germany</h3>
          <p>I am currently in LA right now, so there is nothing to know except that later on in the summer, I will go to Germany and will
          have updates for you. So don't worry!

          22 days, thank you for your patience!</p>
          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>These will be my favorite hobbies. Once again, I recomend all of them to you.</p>
          <h4>Pixelmon</h4>
          <p>Pixelmon is something called a mod for minecraft. Or you can just download Technic Launcher and them download the modpack
            for pixelmon. I would search for pixelspark. There will be a link below for Technic Launcher.</p>
          <a href="http://technicpack.net">technicpack.net</a>
          <h4>Doctor Who</h4>
          <p>Doctor Who is a popular show from 1965. Amazing right? Knew it! So, it has monsters in it, so it is the best!
          Also, it is about an alien that looks like a human,  but is called a time lord. There are many enemies of them because they
          are one of the most powerful species ever! There main enemy is a species called the daleks, they are the scariest and merciless
          of them all! There was a time war, which was time lords vs. the daleks. The Doctor, that is his name for the show, almost
          wiped out both species, because some of the daleks survived, by using the most powerful bomb. So now he travels in his TARDIS
          with companions that always end up either dieing, or just stops traveling with him. By the way, if you want to watch it, you
          can on netflix, or BBC.</p>
          <h4>Minecraft</h4>
          <p>Most of you know and play minecraft, so you know all about it. For those of you who don't know what minecraft is, or
            just don't know what to do on it, it is a video game for Ipods, Ipads, Iphones, and computers! You can have servers, which
            is a world where a bunch of other people can play on and team up with other players, or just do PvP. There is something called
            mods where you can add more things to minecraft, to know more you can watch a video on how to install mods, or you can ask
            a friend. There is a link below for minecaft.</p>
          <a href="http://minecraft.net">minecraft.net</a>
          
          <h4>Coding</h4>
          <p>Coding is a big part of the world! Making websites require coding, even this one! Isn't that shocking? If you would like to know how
            to code, just go to codecademy.com. There will also be a link below for codecademy. I hope you like coding!</p>
          <a href="http://codecademy.com">codecademy.com</a>
          <h3>Before middle school and how I feel about it</h3>
          <p>I am going into 6th grade, and I am excited, after all, all my friends and I are going to the same middle school, Paul Revere!
            I just can't wait until it starts!</p>
          <h3>Freinds</h3>
          <p>Friends can be found in many places, in the world, your house, and your heart. People can have many freinds, like me. My
            #1 friend is Hayden! He helps me with anything on a computer when I need help when my dad isn't around. There is also Andrew,
            Lukas, Brendon, Nickolas, and many more as well! Friends can help you accompilsh anything, not literally, by helping you when
            you need it, and cheering you on. So if you are shy, don't worry! Nobody is out to get you, nobody hates you.</p>
