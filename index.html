         If you don't, remember, it is my first time doing this.This webpage will include some of my favorite hobbies, and I would
         recomend all of them to you. By the way, I am making a new website! It is private right now, but it will show up eventually.
         I will have a link for it when it's public, which is going to be soon. I may stop having updates so, thank you!</h2>

          <h3>Germany</h3>
          <p>I am currently in LA right now, so there is nothing to know except that later on in the summer, I will go to Germany and will
          have updates for you. So don't worry!</p>
          <p>Saturday, June 28 11:23, Sorry if you are waiting for the next update for this and it hasn't come. I will have that update in
          22 days, thank you for your patience! I landed in Germany, but I will not go into detail. I won't because I have a website that
          does, it will be public in about 9 weeks, if not less. I'll have updates for you later!</p>
          <p>July 20, 12:13AM, I am in Germany now, and on my other website, which I am having problems with, has all the updates about the trip.
            It will be fixed soon, and when it is, I will tell you guys, the URL is,</p>
            <a href=http://whatthecode.com>whatthecode.com</a>

          <h3>Hobbies</h3>
          <p>These will be my favorite hobbies. Once again, I recomend all of them to you. If you want me to include YOUR hobbies, tell me
          which ones to add, and I will add them!</p>
          <h5>Pixelmon</h5>
          <p>Pixelmon is something called a mod for minecraft. There will be a link to download Pixelmon below.

          <h5>Coding</h5>
          <p>Coding is a big part of the world! Making websites require coding, even this one! Though this kind of coding is really easy
            to learn and use. So I would recommend one of the more challenging ones, like on octopress. If you don't know what
            octopress is, it gelps you make a REAL website. You need all kinds of coding laungauge. Like HTML, CSS, sometimes JAVASCRIPT,
            and sometimes even RUBY, there is anotherone that is really hard to learn that I am trying to learn called PYTHON.
            So there will be a link below for octpress if you are interested. If you would like to know how to code, just go to codecademy.com
            (which will be right on top of the Multiple webpages! section). There will also be a link below for codecademy.</p>

          <h5>Before middle school and how I feel about it</h5>
          <p>I am going into 6th grade, and I am excited, after all, all my friends and I are going to the same middle school, Paul Revere!
            I just can't wait until it starts!</p>

            <h5>During middle school</h5>
            <p>Middle school is awesome! I kept moving from one class to another, like charter professient, the charter honors, then the best,
              magnet homors! It is so cool with different teachers and different people in each class so you can make friends with them!!</p>


            <h5>Hunger Games</h5>
            <p>The Hunger Games is an incredible book and movie series! There are 3 books. The first is called "The Hunger Games", the second is
              "Catching Fire", and the third is "Mockingjay". The first and second movie have come out already. So has mockingjay, but as part 1,
              it came out on November 21, 2014.</p>

              <h3>Multiple webpages!</h3>
              <p>I have another webpage! The link to it will be after this section. This will have all the crafting recipes. I will keep
                making more webpages until one of the three following things happen, 1:I don't want any more webpages, 2:All of the subjects here
                are fine, or 3:The computer won't let me make anymore. I think the latter will never happen(latter means later one). Also, the newest
                one, the one nearest to the bottom, has a lot of bugs in it, when I say bugs, I mean stuff like glitches</p>
                <a href="DoctorWho.html">noahecampbell/DoctorWho.net</a>

                <p>The link to the third webpage is below this.</p>

                <h5>Daftpunkonsole</h5>
                <p>Some of you might know something called daft punk. There is a website called daftpunkonsole.com. It allows you to play one of
                  their songs. I will not spoil it and tell you which one. The link to it will be down below. The DaftPunkonsole webiste is now
                  disabled. I am creating something similar to it, I will use similar code, and create it again, only now with the Doctor Who
                  theme.</p>
