          <h3>Germany</h3>
          <p>I am currently in LA right now, so there is nothing to know except that later on in the summer, I will go to Germany and will
          have updates for you. So don't worry!</p>
          <h3>Hobies</h3>
          <p>These will be my favorute hobbies. Once again, I recomend all of them to you.</p>
          <h4>Pixelmon</h4>
          <p>Pixelmon is something called a mod for minecraft. Or you can just download Technic Launcher and them download the modpack
            for pixelmon. I would search for pixelspark. There will be a link below for Technic Launcher.</p>
          <a href="website URL">TechnicLauncher.com</a>
          <h4>Doctor Who</h4>
          <p>Doctor Who is a popular show from 1965. Amazing huh? So, it has monsters in it, so it is the best!
          Also, it is about an alien that looks like a human,  but is called a time lord. There are many enemies of them because they
          are one of the most powerful species ever! There main enemy is a species called the daleks, they are the scariest and merciless
          species of them all! There was a time war, which was time lords vs. the daleks. The Doctor, that is his name for the show,
          wiped out both species, except some of the daleks survived, by using the most powerful bomb. So now he travels in his TARDIS
          with companions that always end up either dieing, or just stops traveling with him.</p>
          <h4>Minecraft</h4>
          <p>Most of you know and play minecraft, so you know all about it. For those of you who don't know what minecraft is, or
            just don't know what to do on it, it is a video game for Ipods, Ipads, Iphones, and computers! You can have servers, which
            is a world where a bunch of other people can play on and team up with other players, or just do PvP. There is something called
            mods where you can add more things to minecraft, to know more you can watch a video on how to install pixelmon, or you can ask
            a friend. There is a link below for minecaft.</p>
