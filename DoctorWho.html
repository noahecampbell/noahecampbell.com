                <h2>Doctor Who and his history(otherwise known as a history lesson on DW).</h2>
                <p>Doctor Who is a TV show that was invented in 1963. This is not just some
                  ordinary TV show, this one is about an alien known as the Doctor who comes
                  to planet Earth, with his TARDIS
                  Time
                  And
                  Relivent
                  Dimension
                  In
                  Space
                    Cool huh? Anyways, he wasn't here to kill humans, but to protect them. The Docotor's species is called the Time Lords.
                  There are many enemies of them because they are one of the most powerful species ever! There main enemy is a species called the
                  daleks, they are the scariest and merciless of them all! There was a time war, which was time lords vs. the daleks. The Doctor
                  almost wiped out both species, but some of the daleks survived, by using the most powerful bomb. So now he travels in his TARDIS
                  with companions that always end up either dieing, or just stops traveling with him. By the way, if you want to watch it, you can
                  on netflix, or BBC. Sorry about the bug with the words on the side of the screen.</p>
